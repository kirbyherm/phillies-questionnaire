<p>
Congratulations on your selection as a semi-finalist to join the 
Phillies Baseball R&amp;D team!  As a means to learn more about each 
candidate, we request that you complete this questionnaire to the best 
of your ability within 96 hours (4 days) of your receipt. 
</p>

<p>
This questionnaire contains two questions. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our application process. Good luck!
</p>


<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <p> Write a project proposal for the following. Use the example posted <a href="https://questionnaire-148920.appspot.com/qas/example.pdf">here</a> as a reference for the format and level of detail we expect.</p>

        <p>Imagine that the Major League outfield coach approaches you 
with the following question: “One of our outfielders, Player X, seems to
 be struggling in the field. He’s got a great arm, but he’s made a few 
errors this season and is failing to get to some balls. Could you look 
into this and identify any problem areas that we can target with 
drills?”</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assume you have access to any data that could be 
relevant, such as batted ball exit data (exit velocity, launch angle, 
etc.), fielder movement data (first step, speed, exchange time, etc.), 
and anything else you are considering for all balls that could be 
fielded by an outfielder.</li>
            <li>Outline the possible approaches, data to be leveraged, 
and proposed methodology. Be sure to mention any shortcomings to the 
approaches and proposal, in addition to any data issues you could 
foresee. Although an analysis section is included in the example above, 
do not complete this section.</li>
            <li>Include any resources you used to formulate or motivate your proposal.</li>
            <li>Your submission will be graded on the soundness and clarity of your proposal.</li>
        </ul>

    The file obp.csv provided at <a href="https://questionnaire-148920.appspot.com/qas/obp.csv">https://questionnaire-148920.appspot.com/qas/obp.csv</a> contains 15 columns:
        </p><ul>
            <li>Name - player’s name</li>
            <li>playerid - player’s Fangraphs ID</li>
            <li>birth_date - player’s date of birth</li>
            <li>PA_21 - player’s plate appearances in 2021</li>
            <li>OBP_21 - player’s on-base percentage in 2021</li>
            <li>PA_20 - player’s plate appearances in 2020</li>
            <li>OBP_20 - player’s on-base percentage in 2020</li>
            <li>PA_19 - player’s plate appearances in 2019</li>
            <li>OBP_19 - player’s on-base percentage in 2019</li>
            <li>PA_18 - player’s plate appearances in 2018</li>
            <li>OBP_18 - player’s on-base percentage in 2018</li>
            <li>PA_17 - player’s plate appearances in 2017</li>
            <li>OBP_17 - player’s on-base percentage in 2017</li>
            <li>PA_16 - player’s plate appearances in 2016</li>
            <li>OBP_16 - player’s on-base percentage in 2016</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
        <p style="margin: 14px 0px">
        Predict each player’s on-base percentage in the 2021 season 
given his plate appearances and on-base percentages in prior seasons.
            </p><ul>
                <li>Your submission will be judged primarily on the 
clarity with which you describe your methodology and present your 
findings and secondarily on the accuracy of your predictions.</li>
                <li>You are <b>definitely not</b> required to do so, but
 if you wish, you are welcome to research and incorporate more data than
 what is provided in the obp.csv file for your predictions. However, you
 may not include any data from Opening Day for the 2021 regular season 
onward. For example, you may include each player’s exit velocity in 
prior seasons if you can find that data and think it will help your 
prediction, but you cannot include each player’s 2021 exit velocity. 
Data in obp.csv came from fangraphs.com.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use any approach, programming language, or software you prefer.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use any mechanism(s) to present your 
results (email, LaTex, R Markdown, Jupyter notebook, Powerpoint, etc.) 
so long as you describe your methodology, include any code, and provide a
 measurement of the accuracy of your predictions. Your analysis should 
be completely reproducible.</li>
                <li>Using online resources such as Stack Overflow is 
encouraged! Just please include a citation (by including a comment in 
your code with a link to the resource).</li>
